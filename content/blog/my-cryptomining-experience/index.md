**On a GTX 1080**—still a very good card today—on my gaming PC using NiceHash. That was when Bitcoin was worth about $4k. At the time, I was just a freshman in high school looking to make a quick buck, essentially free money with my parents paying for the electricity—I was afterall heating the basement. I was only slightly interested in cryptocurrencies, occasionally looking at the prices on [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en) and re-partitioning my, at the time, Coinbase portfolio into a bit of ETH and LINK during the otherwise boring English class—except for when we watched Romeo and Juliet 1968.

**I kept on mining until** the great bull and crash of 2017-2018. I clearly remember everybody in my family telling me to sell, sell, sell, like seagulls devouring food on the beach. I probably would have, however I didn't actaully have a way to convert that crypto into fiat. Although this may seem bad on the surface, it was a massive positive for me and taught me a lesson in patience. Compared to the prices at the time of writing this, ~$50k BTC and ~$2k ETH, I'm glad I HODL'd then.

**The only thing that I regret**, is stopping mining. I don't exactly remember why I stopped, probably because I lost interest due to the crash.

**Fast forward to the winter of 2019-2020**, right before the Coronavirus pandemic took the world by a surprise. I decided to give crypto another chance after reading [The Bullish Case for Bitcoin](https://vijayboyapati.medium.com/the-bullish-case-for-bitcoin-6ecc8bdecc1)—a phenomenal read by the way. I went back to my old trusted method of NiceHash and Coinbase for a couple of weeks until I decided that I was sick of Windows 10. I was sick of stupid updates, the goddamn pop-up notifications that would cause me to crash my plane in WarThunder, and just the general clunky user interface. Plus, I was slowly moving away from gaming as my interest in RC flight took over. Ubuntu, here I come!

**Eventually, after countless hours**, probably countless dozens of hours, I was mining ETH with PhoenixMiner on Ubuntu, this time to [Exodus wallet](https://www.exodus.com/)—a wallet that I still use to this day. I also started using the OhGodAnETHlargementPill, which when administered to my GTX 1080 yielded 35, maybe even 36 Mh/s instead of the 28-30 that I was getting before.

**I kept mining ETH non-stop** until about June of the same year. Having heard of [Nerd Gearz](https://nerdgearz.com/) from a [Red Panda Mining video](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAGsnTCpw7pvhR4RAlEQGzg), I found a fantastic deal on some used Gigabyte Aorus RX 580's, so I bought two for a price of $200, which at this point has payed for itself many times over. It's crazy to think that these gpus can—at the time of writing—be sold for almost **$300 each** due to the famous GPU shortage and insane demand from crypto miners. I pointed the two RX 580s to mine ETH, while I switched the GTX 1080 over to RVN, and was earning about 50 RVN each day!

**Fast forward to November 2021**, and I pointed the GTX 1080 back to ETH. I also managed to pick up a Red Devil RX 5700XT on Craiglist—an absolute beast of a GPU—for about $350 used. I also invested in a hardware wallet, the [Ledger Nano X](https://shop.ledger.com/products/ledger-nano-x), to keep my crypto as safe as possible.

**So to this day**, I have a GTX 1080, and a RTX 2080 mining ETH with *MinerWrangler*, and two RX 580's and a RX 5700XT mining ETH using HiveOS unfortunately. *I still haven't figured out how to use AMD drivers headlessly.* However, I might switch the GTX 1080 to RVN as recently, the popularity of the project has gone up by a lot!

**Who knows, maybe I'll major in Blockchain development**—I find crypto fascinating and believe in a decentralized future.
